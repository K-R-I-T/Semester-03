1) Assume that x, y, z are integer variables and that s is a stack of integers. State the
output of the following program fragment.
x = 3;y = 5;z = 2;
s.makeEmpty( );
s.push(x);s.push(4);s.pop();
s.push(y);s.push(3); s.push(z);
s.pop();s.push(2);s.push(x);
while(! s.isEmpty( )) System.out.println(s.pop() + " ");

Output: 3 2 3 5 3

2) Assume that x, y are integer variables and that s is a stack of integers. State the
output of the following program fragment.
x = 3; y = 1;
s.makeEmpty();
s.push(5);s.push(7);s.pop();
x += y;
s.pop();
s.push(x);s.push(y); s.push(2);s.pop();s.pop();
while (! s.isEmpty( )) {
 y = s.pop();
 System.out.println(y);
}
System.out.println("x = " + x);
System.out.println("y = " + y);

Output: 4 4 4

3) A letter means push and an asterisk means pop in the following sequence. Give the
sequence of values returned by the pop operations when this sequence of
operations is performed on an initially empty stack.
E A S * Y * Q U E * * * S T * * * I O * N * * *

Output: S Y E U Q T S A O N I E

4) A letter means push and an asterisk means pop in the following sequence. Give the
contents of s[0], ..., s[4] after this sequence of operations is performed on an
initially empty stack (the stack is implementated by array s[]).
L A * S T I * N * F I R * S T * * O U * T * * * * * *

Output: EmptyStackException

5) A letter means enqueue and an asterisk means dequeue in the following
sequence. Give the sequence of values returned by the dequeue operation when
this sequence of operations is performed on an initially empty queue.
E A S * Y * Q U E * * * S T * * * I O * N * * *

Output: E A S Y Q U E S T I O N

6) A letter means enqueue and an asterisk means dequeue in the following
sequence. Give the contents of q[0], ..., q[4] after this sequence of operations is
performed on an initially empty queue (the queue is implementated by circular
array q[] with size 5).
E A S * Y * Q U E * * * S T * * * I O * N * * *

Output: null
